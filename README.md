# Data-Driven Analysis of Canada's Innovation Performance

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of Canada's innovation performance from 2014 to 2024. Leveraging the Global Innovation Index (GII) and additional international innovation benchmarks, we identified strengths and weaknesses within Canada’s innovation ecosystem, proposed targeted strategies for enhancement, and developed an AI-powered chatbot prototype to support innovation-related decision-making and communication.

## Objectives

- Evaluate Canada's innovation performance relative to global standards.
- Identify key drivers of innovation performance using statistical and machine learning techniques.
- Provide actionable strategies to enhance Canada's innovation landscape.
- Develop an interactive chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate real-time information retrieval and decision support.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- Collected historical Global Innovation Index data (2014-2024) from official reports and structured datasets.
- Developed custom Python scripts in Jupyter Notebooks to parse, clean, and organize data into structured, analyzable formats.

### 2. Exploratory and Comparative Analysis
- Analyzed Canada’s ranking across seven key innovation pillars.
- Conducted comparative analyses against leading global economies to benchmark Canada’s strengths and weaknesses.

### 3. Machine Learning and Feature Importance
- Implemented a Random Forest model to identify the top 15 global drivers influencing innovation.
- Standardized data using Z-scores for intuitive cross-country comparisons.

### 4. Strategic Recommendations
- Recommended improvements in innovation investment and capital market practices, inspired by successful international models from Singapore and Switzerland.
- Proposed enhancements for knowledge commercialization, focusing on intellectual property (IP) management and industry-academic partnerships.
- Suggested policies for sustaining Canada's advantage in human capital and research, including skills development programs and talent attraction strategies.

### 5. AI-Powered Chatbot
- Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using GPT-4o and Deepseek models for interactive user engagement.
- Integrated vector embeddings (NV-Embed-QA) with the Astra vector database to efficiently handle knowledge-intensive queries.

## Technologies and Methods
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest
- **Data Visualization:** Radar Charts, Bar Charts, Heatmaps, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **AI Frameworks:** LangChain, NV-Embed-QA embeddings, GPT-4o, Deepseek

## Project Outcomes
- Identified Canada’s robust performance in Human Capital, Research, and Market Sophistication.
- Highlighted significant gaps in Innovation Investment and Commercialization.
- Provided a strategic roadmap to potentially elevate Canada's global innovation ranking from 14th to approximately 10th by 2030.
- Successfully demonstrated an LLM-driven chatbot to facilitate real-time access and decision-making support regarding innovation policy data.
